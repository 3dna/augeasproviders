{"body":"# augeasproviders: alternative Augeas-based providers for Puppet\r\n\r\nThis module provides alternative providers for core Puppet types such as\r\n`host` and `mailalias` using the Augeas configuration library.  It also adds\r\nsome of its own types for new functionality.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of using Augeas over the default Puppet `parsedfile`\r\nimplementations is that Augeas will go to great lengths to preserve file\r\nformatting and comments, while also failing safely when needed.\r\n\r\nThese providers will hide *all* of the Augeas commands etc., you don't need to\r\nknow anything about Augeas to make use of it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make changes to config files in your own way, you should use\r\nthe `augeas` type directly.  For more information about Augeas, see the\r\n[web site](http://augeas.net) or the\r\n[Puppet/Augeas](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Puppet_Augeas)\r\nwiki page.\r\n\r\n## Using augeasproviders\r\n\r\nFor builtin types, change the provider on individual resources to `augeas`:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nhost { \"example.com\":\r\n  ensure   => present,\r\n  ip       => \"10.1.2.3\",\r\n  provider => \"augeas\",\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nOr change the [resource\r\ndefaults](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_defaults.html)\r\nglobally or in a single scope for the types needed from the list below:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nHost {\r\n  provider => \"augeas\",\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nNew types provided by augeasproviders can be used out of the box.  See the list\r\nbelow and `puppet doc -r type` output.\r\n\r\n## Types and providers\r\n\r\nThe following builtin types have an Augeas-based provider implemented:\r\n\r\n  * `host`\r\n  * `mailalias`\r\n\r\nThe following other types have a provider implemented:\r\n\r\n  * `mounttab` from [puppetlabs-mount_providers](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/mount_providers)\r\n\r\nThe module adds the following new types:\r\n\r\n  * `kernel_parameter` for adding kernel parameters to GRUB Legacy or GRUB 2 configs\r\n  * `nrpe_command` for setting command entries in Nagios NRPE's `nrpe.cfg`\r\n  * `sshd_config` for setting configuration entries in OpenSSH's `sshd_config`\r\n  * `sshd_config_subsystem` for setting subsystem entries in OpenSSH's `sshd_config`\r\n  * `sysctl` for entries inside Linux's sysctl.conf\r\n  * `syslog` for entries inside syslog.conf\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nEnsure both Augeas and ruby-augeas 0.3.0+ bindings are installed and working as\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nSee [Puppet/Augeas pre-requisites](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Puppet_Augeas#Pre-requisites).\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nOn Puppet 2.7.14+, the module can be installed easily ([documentation](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/modules_installing.html)):\r\n\r\n    puppet module install domcleal/augeasproviders\r\n\r\nYou may see an error similar to this on Puppet 2.x ([#13858](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/13858)):\r\n\r\n    Error 400 on SERVER: Puppet::Parser::AST::Resource failed with error ArgumentError: Invalid resource type `kernel_parameter` at ...\r\n\r\nEnsure the module is present in your puppetmaster's own environment (it doesn't\r\nhave to use it) and that the master has pluginsync enabled.  Run the agent on\r\nthe puppetmaster to cause the custom types to be synced to its local libdir\r\n(`puppet master --configprint libdir`) and then restart the puppetmaster so it\r\nloads them.\r\n\r\n## Planned\r\n\r\nThe following builtin types have Augeas-based providers planned:\r\n\r\n  * `ssh_authorized_key`\r\n  * `port`, once [#5660](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/5660) is done\r\n  * `yumrepo`, once [#8758](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/8758) is done\r\n\r\nOther ideas for new types are:\r\n\r\n  * `/etc/system` types\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\nPlease file any issues or suggestions [on GitHub](https://github.com/hercules-team/augeasproviders/issues).\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
